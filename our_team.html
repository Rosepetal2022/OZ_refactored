          Mia began riding when she was five. During her childhood she helped produce green ponies, competed in the pony
          hunter and equitation divisions, and rode and trained her own young thoroughbreds. In 2014, Mia attended
          Chatham Hall boarding school in Virginia to ride for their IEA team where she gained immense experience riding
          and showing a variety of horses. Upon returning to Oregon, Mia showed and helped produce her, then green
          hunter, Casperia (now known as Delightful) to great success. The pair was awarded USHJA Zone IX Horse of the
          Year in the Small Junior Hunter 16-17 in 2016. In the same year, Mia was awarded high point rider at the
          College Preparatory Invitational Horse Show in Burbank, California. She competed in the hunters, jumpers and
          equitation divisions on various horses and continued to develop ponies through her junior years. Mia has her
          Bachelor of Science degree in Public Health. While at college, she worked in both Pediatrics and Labor &
          Delivery as a Nursing Assistant. Upon completing her degree, Mia’s true passion remained in horses and as a
          result she joined the Oz Inc team. Mia is a strong supporter of the local NW community and desires to help
          local shows remain viable by increasing access to everyone.

          Jessica started riding when she was six and has been in love with the sport ever since. As a junior, Jessie competed in the hunters, jumpers, and equitation divisions under the training of Triple Rise Equestrian Center. 
          Shortly after, she set about achieving her aspirations to pursue the high level jumpers, with a specific goal of competing in the FEI. In 2017, she moved to Portland, to be a working student at Oz Inc.  
          She learned to balance her busy work responsibilities with her passion for the sport and climbed the ladder both in and out of the competition ring. 
          She rose from riding in the 1.10m up to the FEI 1.50m level on her great mare, Cerafina. In 2020 Jessica became an official USEF professional. 
          She is a very fast, competitive jumper rider with countless wins to her name. She can ride anything from 1.50m jumpers all the way down to baby green hunters.  
          She loves to teach and is a certifiable “horse junkie”.

          Caleb, originally from Omaha, Nebraska joined the OZ  training staff  in 2020. 
          Horses peaked Caleb’s interest at a very early age and almost immediately he knew horses had to be an integral part of his life. 
          Caleb spent most of his junior years competing locally around the Midwest, and in 2014 he was offered a working student position at Equi-Venture Farm in Topeka, KS, under Brandie and Hunter Holloway. 
          His position really opened the door for him into the sport at a top level, where he was able to attend and compete at  shows all around the country.  
          During that time, he had the opportunity to ride many different types of horses and gained insight and knowledge as to  what it takes to get to the top level of the sport. 
          Caleb champions quality horsemanship, quality horse care,  quality training,  and discipline. 
          He is a fanatic for attention to detail and has a passion for learning about the sport, the horses, and everything in between. 
          Not only does Caleb love to ride, but he loves to teach and comes to Oz with a depth of experience teaching. 
          He finds much joy in helping people gain experience and knowledge on and off the horse. 
          From his humble beginnings to now, Caleb has enjoyed great success. 
          He has had countless championships showing hunters and won his first USHJA National Derby in 2022.
          Caleb was the WCHR 2023 Champion Developing Pro and Reserve Champion Professional in the NW Region. 
          His year finished off spectacularly with a 3rd place finish in the 2023 USHJA World Champion Hunter Rider National Rankings.

          Emily Perkins has been riding horses since she was seven. She started showing ponies in the hunter and equitation divisions and evolved into the prominent junior, of her era, in the Pacific Northwest. 
          With Shelley Campf, she helped develop her young and green equitation/hunter crossover horse, New England, to great success.  Her junior years boasted many accolades.  
          The pair were winners in multiple USHJA National Hunter Derbies, had top placings in International Hunter Derbies, and won countless championships in the Junior Hunter and equitation divisions. 
          In 2017 Emily won the Region 7 ASPCA Maclay Regional Championships, in 2019 she won the OHJA Junior Senior Medal Finals and she competed at the fall indoor shows at the Capital Challenge, Pennsylvania National and the National horse show for multiple years. 
          Emily primarily trained with Oz Inc., but in 2019, her last junior year, Shelley organized for Emily to train back east to get a taste of a different environment training with Ken Smith and Ashland Farm.  
          That fall she was Reserve Champion in the Equitation division at the Capital Challenge, 7th in both the North American Junior Equitation Championships and the North American Flat Equitation Championships. 
          At the USEF Hunter Seat Medal Finals, Emily was in the top group and she finished out her junior career with a top performance in the ASPCA Maclay Finals at the National Horse Show.
          Emily rode as an amateur while in college and developed a love for showing jumpers! She won the OHJA Jr/Sr Medal Finals for a second time in 2021, was Champion Amateur Equitation and placed in the North American Adult Equitation Championships at the Capital Challenge Horse Show in 2021.  
          In the summer of 2022, Emily declared her professional status and began helping riders achieve their goals. In 2023 she graduated from the University of Oregon graduating Magna Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, a concentration in marketing, and a minor in Economics. 
          While her education offers her many opportunities, Emily’s passion is with horses.
