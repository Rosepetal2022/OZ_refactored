          Mia began riding when she was five. During her childhood she helped produce green ponies, competed in the pony
          hunter and equitation divisions, and rode and trained her own young thoroughbreds. In 2014, Mia attended
          Chatham Hall boarding school in Virginia to ride for their IEA team where she gained immense experience riding
          and showing a variety of horses. Upon returning to Oregon, Mia showed and helped produce her, then green
          hunter, Casperia (now known as Delightful) to great success. The pair was awarded USHJA Zone IX Horse of the
          Year in the Small Junior Hunter 16-17 in 2016. In the same year, Mia was awarded high point rider at the
          College Preparatory Invitational Horse Show in Burbank, California. She competed in the hunters, jumpers and
          equitation divisions on various horses and continued to develop ponies through her junior years. Mia has her
          Bachelor of Science degree in Public Health. While at college, she worked in both Pediatrics and Labor &
          Delivery as a Nursing Assistant. Upon completing her degree, Mia’s true passion remained in horses and as a
          result she joined the Oz Inc team. Mia is a strong supporter of the local NW community and desires to help
          local shows remain viable by increasing access to everyone.
